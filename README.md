# hangman-game
A text-based word-guessing challenge implemented in Python.

## Overview:
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. It's a simple yet entertaining game where players attempt to guess a secret word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. With each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman is drawn until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts and the hangman is complete.

## How to Play:

Setup: The game selects a random word from the word bank and initializes the hangman display.

Guessing: Players input letters they believe are part of the secret word.

Feedback: The game provides feedback on each guess, revealing any correct letters and updating the hangman display for incorrect guesses.

Win/Lose Conditions: The game continues until the player correctly guesses the word (win) or exhausts their attempts, resulting in the completion of the hangman (lose).

## Features:

Customizable Word Bank: The game includes a customizable word bank from which the secret word is randomly selected, allowing for endless variations and challenges.

User-Friendly Interface: The game provides a clear and intuitive interface for players to input guesses and receive feedback.
